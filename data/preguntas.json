It states that the sampling frequency (also known as pulse repetition frequency or PRF in Doppler ultrasound) must be at least twice the frequency of the signal being measured to ensure accurate reconstruction and to prevent aliasing. The Nyquist limit is calculated as PRF / 2, meaning that if the PRF is 5 kHz, frequencies up to 2.5 kHz can be accurately measured. If the frequency shift due to blood flow exceeds this limit, aliasing occurs, and the measurement becomes distorted. To avoid this, either the PRF should be increased or the transducer frequency should be lowered to ensure reliable and accurate frequency measurements.",
