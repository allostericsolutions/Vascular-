    "concept_to_study": "A positive Doppler shift occurs when the blood flow is moving towards the transducer.",
    "explicacion_openai": "Transducer A is positioned such that blood flow is moving towards it. This results in a higher received frequency compared to the transmitted frequency, hence a positive Doppler shift."
